# The method lookup path is the order a program checks for a specific
# method definition once that method is called. It is important,
# because, in the instance that a program has mulitple methods with
# the same name - the one that is found first will be the one that is
# called. It's important to ensure that the method being called, is the
# method you intend to call, and not just another method with the same
# name.
